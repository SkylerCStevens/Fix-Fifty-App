# Fix Fifty App
With Charlotte dead last (50) on the list of largest cities in the United States on economic mobility we had to come up with something to help our community. Our idea was to confront the problem head on, people need jobs quick. Interviewing and training make the task of getting a new job a long process so to streamline this we came up with the idea of connecting companies and workers for quick-temp jobs based on the workers skills. These skills would be verified through standardized quick interviews based on our partner companies' needs. 

## Reaching the Community
We are working to connect with local non-profits to find the individuals who need this app, as well as ensure they have the necessary resources to access it. Our first thought was NC Works. This organization has facilities where individuals can use computers to apply for jobs. It is usually where citizens in unemployment are directed. We also found the Goodwill Opportunity Center which has a job resource branch to help people find employment. By working with these kinds of programs we can reach our audience and help these centers quickly find solutions for those in need.
